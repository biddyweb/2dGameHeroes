Simple iPhone game I created during college.

I am planning to flesh it out a bit (or maybe scrap it all together. I'll see)

The first thing I am planning is the removal and replacement of  all copywrited material (and upgrade the presentation from bargin basement/clip-art to something a little more tasteful). This would include the icons, music, and sound effects. 

I'm not sure where I want to go with the interface as far as gameplay is concerned. Currently, I'm leaning towards a 'touch to attack' replacement for the very boring gameplay that this project has currently. 

If I go that route, I would like to eventually implement a body part targetting system and building a more strategic game from that idea.
