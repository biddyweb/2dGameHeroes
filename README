Simple iPhone game I created during college.

I am planning to flesh it out a bit (or maybe scrap it all together. I'll see)

The first thing I am planning is to remove all copywrited material (and upgrade the presentation from bargin basement/clip-art to something a little more tasteful) in the
program. This would include the icons, music, and sound effects.
